### Project title

***Hommie***

### What and why?
Hommie (Real Estate Tinder) is an app to help you find houses, apartments, and other real estate properties with reduced inefficiencies in communications. Sellers will be able to build their profile with their properties for sale and rental. Buyers will be able to swipe right if they like the property and swipe left if they are not interested. Sellers can also check buyers’ profiles, and they will be able to start to chat if they are matched up.
**AppName** is aiming to 

### For whom?

There are plenty of people who require Real estate services, so there’s always space for innovation in the pursuit of housing. This app is for people who want to sell/rent their properties and for people who want a compatible home with ease.

### How?

There will be a way to store the listing
A way to form a profile to prompt the listings with the specified search criteria (apartment/condo/house, basically the housexual orientation).
There will be an equivalent messaging platform to connect sellers to the matched buyers who are interested in their listings.
Buyers will be asked to build a profile that includes their preferences:
possible things to list on the buyer’s profile:
	Rent or Buy
	Residential or Commercial
	Neighborhood
	Price
	Surrounding School/education
	Garage Space
	Being near train/bus/park/school/supermarket
	Commute time to suburb/city (if not in city/suburb)
Sellers:
	Rules and restrictions
	Pictures of the listings
	
### Scope
Creating the search tool and database will take approximately 1 week. Most of the time will be devoted to test functionality and build front end components. Chat system will take 1 week. All the tasks can be done concurrently. So our team thinks this project is manageable with 4-6 members in one semester.
